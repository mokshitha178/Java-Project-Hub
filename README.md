This Java-based Number Guessing Game challenges players to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range. Players are given a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number, with feedback provided on whether guesses are too high or too low. The game tracks the number of correct guesses and allows players to play multiple rounds, aiming to improve their score with each attempt.

This is a Java-based Grade Calculator that computes and displays a student's grade based on the marks entered for multiple subjects. After inputting the number of subjects and their respective marks, the application calculates the total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade, providing a clear evaluation of performance.

This Java-based ATM Interface simulates basic banking operations, including checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing funds. The application uses a BankAccount class to manage the balance and an ATM class to handle user interactions through a menu-driven interface. Users can perform transactions and view their balance through a simple console-based menu. This project provides a practical example of object-oriented programming and user interface design in Java.
